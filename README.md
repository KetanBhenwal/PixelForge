# Image Converter (PNG, JPEG, WEBP, BMP)

This is a Next.js single page application for converting images between PNG, JPEG, WEBP, and BMP formats. The app runs entirely in your browserâ€”no uploads required. It is optimized for SEO and supports Google Ads integration.

## Features
- Convert images between PNG, JPEG, WEBP, and BMP formats
- Fast, private, and free (no server upload)
- SEO optimized for better ranking
- Google Ads support (replace ad client/slot in layout)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
